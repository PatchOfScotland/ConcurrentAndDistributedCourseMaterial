# Concurrent_and_Distributed_Course_Material

This repoisitory shows the course material available to students during the 2018-2019 Concurrent and Distributed Systems course avaiable at the University of Copenhagen. Originally it was avaiable within the universites own web portal, which unfortunatly is not publicly accessible, and so it is presented here.
